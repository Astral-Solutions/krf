        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          The Koketso Rakhudu Foundation was established on 1 May 2016 to address educational and skills gaps in underserved communities.
          As an accredited training center, the Foundation provides SETA-recognized programmes that prepare individuals for employment,
          entrepreneurship, and personal development.
          <br /><br />
          KRF was inspired by the Royal Bafokeng Nation Vision Plan 2035. It was planted from a seed passed to Kgosana Dr. Koketso Rakhudu by
          Kgosi Leruo Molotlegi, and today it thrives as a response to the needs of rural South Africa through sustainable community-based solutions.
